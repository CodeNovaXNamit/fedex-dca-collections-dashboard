📦 FedEx DCA Collections Dashboard with AI Prioritizer
🚀 Project Overview

FedEx works with multiple Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs) to recover overdue payments.
Currently, much of this process relies on manual spreadsheets and emails, which leads to slow recoveries, poor visibility, and inefficient prioritization.

This project is a prototype AI-powered collections dashboard that:

Centralizes overdue accounts

Uses a lightweight ML model to prioritize accounts by likelihood of payment

Provides a simple dashboard for monitoring and assignment

All data used in this project is synthetic and created for demonstration purposes only.
